# Sudoku Dash (Server)

*A realtime cooperative multiplayer sudoku for the web.*

This was a toy project (the kind of toy project you spend a full year on) to familiarize myself with:

- WebSockets and realtime web games
- Erlang, OTP and distributed systems in general
- Test driven development
- Generation of Sudoku puzzles

If I find the time, I'll try to get it running somewhere again.
